By "workspace" we refer to the directory containing all your project files. For
example raw datasets, source code, ML models, etc. A workspace becomes a DVC
project when [\`dvc init\`](/doc/commands-reference/init) is run, and
[DVC-files](/doc/user-guide/dvc-file-format) are created in it. It\s typically
also a Git repository.
