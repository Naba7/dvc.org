# Install

There are a few recommended ways to install DVC: OS-specific package/installer,
`pip`, `conda` (Anaconda), and Homebrew. (Depending on your OS, some of these
may be not available.)

To install DVC from `pip` (see instructions for other options below), run:

```dvc
$ pip install dvc
```

> If you installed DVC via `pip`, depending on the
> [remote](/doc/commands-reference/remote) type you plan to use you might need
> to install optional dependencies: `[s3]`, `[ssh]`, `[gs]`, `[azure]`, and
> `[oss]`; or `[all]` to include them all. The command should look like this:
> `pip install "dvc[s3]"` - it installs `boto3` library along with DVC to
> support AWS S3 storage.

The easiest option, self-contained binary packages (or Windows installer), are
available by using the big "Download" button in the [home page](/). You may also
get them [here](https://github.com/iterative/dvc/releases/).
